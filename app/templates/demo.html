                        According to the definition that shows up in the Google search <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+memes&oq=what+are+memes">what are memes</a>,
                        they are
                        <br>
                        <b> "an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation."</b>
                        <br>
                        An alternate definition of meme is <b>"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variation) and spread rapidly by Internet users."</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>The origin of the word is from the Greek word <i>mimÄ“ma</i> 'that which is imitated' combined with the word pattern of the English work <i>gene</i>.</p>
                    <br>

                        There are many articles on the Internet that try to explain what memes are, including this very page.
                        The <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-meme-2483702">article</a> from lifewire.com says the following:
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <p><b>A 'meme' is a virally-transmitted cultural symbol or social idea. </b></p>
                        <p>The majority of modern memes are captioned photos that are intended to be funny, often as a way to publicly ridicule human behavior. Other memes can be videos and verbal expressions. Some memes have heavier and more philosophical content.</p>
                        <p>The world of memes (which rhymes with 'teams') is noteworthy for two reasons: <i>it is a worldwide social phenomenon, and memes behave like a mass of infectious flu and cold viruses, traveling from person to person quickly through social media.</i></p>
                        <p><i>According to Cecil Adams of theStraightDope.com, the concept of memes "is either really deep, or really, really obvious".</i></p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Here is a video explaining memes:</p>

                    <p>This is a classic meme of Boromir speaking in the Council of Elrond.</p>
                    <p>In the movie he says the line <b>"One does not simply walk into Mordor."</b> He is stating that the thing that they were suggesting was not as easy as they were making it sound.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So naturally this scene has been used to make memes of all sorts of things that are difficult to do.</p>
